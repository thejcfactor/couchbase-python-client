The casitas are funky but comfortable--and most importantly they are air conditioned. Down by the water there's also a restaurant in season (not open in the summer) and a swimming pool. You'll take a long, rutted road to get to Tamarindo, but by then you'll be used to potholes and ditches since all the roads on Culebra could use a good coat of asphalt. Recommended for families, friends or couples.",

The Roman Spa is a decent place to stay but is not a resort by any stretch of the imagination. It's an old establishment and shows it, but generally is comfortable. The rooms are updated, but the air conditioning unit is dismal. It was impossible to find a good setting during the night, it was either too cold, but when you turned it up a bit, you woke up sweating. Lots of older couples there which I thought was endearing. The baths are quite old and the tiles are fading badly, but that didn't seem to bother anyone. The reception and service seems to be an afterthought for those who work there. With the exception of a nice young lady, they would just let you stand at the counter indefinitely as they walked back and forth doing \"their work\". It's okay for one night, but I didn't feel it lived up to it's description on the website.",

Quietly located across from a historical building, it is conveniently located to shops, restaurants, a market, art galleries, and book stores. At night it is quiet. The gardens at the Spa are beautifully tended. Many waterfalls or fountains created a peaceful and serene atmosphere. The soaking and swimming pools are small but I never felt crowded. Three pools offer temperatures from warm to hot with the jacuzzi being the hottest of the three. It is wonderful to sit outside in the sun. Deck chairs and recliners are located throughout the Spa grounds for relaxing. A picnic and Bar-B-Que area is equipped with Weber stoves and the items necessary to have a fun outdoor dinner. At night the pools are softly lit and the night sky, midnight blue when we visited, is filled with stars. Coffee is organic Thanksgiving coffee sustainably grown. Instead of those tedius little pots in each room, you can walk to the office and enjoy as much coffee as you like. Our room did not have a kitchenette but did have a refrigerator. We enjoyed lunch and breakfast (fruits and salads) during the day time at the Spa but ate dinner in town. The staff is friendly and our maid spoke both English and Spanish. She was very helpful when we asked her to make up a couch into a day bed. We love the Roman Spa. This is our 15th year of visiting the Spa. I would recommend the Roman Spa to my friends.",

                  "content": "First, I'd like to advise readers that the words \"spa\" and \"resort\" are freely bandied around in relation to the motels in Calistoga, and somehow I missed that when researching the Roman Spa Hot Springs Resort. (The word \"motel\" is on their sign, seen if you go directly to their site online.) This is an important distinction that I overlooked - a Motel as opposed to a Hotel - and this evidences itself in terms of austerity in accomodations. All the glowing reviews on this site caused me to abandon a more comprehensive research, so I'd like to give a very thorough review so people can make up their minds with a variety of info. I was hoping for a hot springs soak, and a rejuvenating stay at this \"resort\". I left feeling very tired and discouraged. The pros are that indeed, the staff is friendly, the grounds and rooms are clean, and the springs are used to full advantage, whether you rent a private whirlpool room as I did, or wish to avail yourself to the pool or hot tub outside. The cons of the place? I was a bit unhappy to detect the scent of chlorine in the outside pool, thinking I would be getting the same unadulterated hot spring soak as I could get in my room. It would have been easier to revel in a body of water that is \"pure\" hot springs water, rather than swimming in something with chemicals in it. But the water was nice, the moon was full, and I continued to try to get into the spirit of my retreat. Back in my room, my partner and I excitedly tried to use our new laptop for the first time...he had bid on an auction item online that was due to close. (I admit that not asking the Roman Spa Motel whether or not they had wireless internet service is my own fault, but since I've seen the rankest little motels advertising it, I erroneously assumed they would have it.) We went to the office to see if there was a complimentary PC for guests, but this was not the case either. I was also able to let this detail go, and my partner and I slipped into the whirlpool in our room. This was a nice feature, hot, pure sulpher-smelling water filled the nicely clean tub...but I was disappointed that the tub wasn't just a bit deeper. My partner and I are small people, so if you're a big guy, be advised that in a sitting position, your shoulders will be way above the water line. Scooching down into the tub, we found it difficult to find a comfortable position and hung the back of our necks on the squared edge of the tub. Romance was not to be....We retired to a hard mattress, and closed the curtains that didn't block out the light from outside to our satisfaction. During the night, we finally surrendered and shut off the window-heater-conditioner unit that vibrated and clanked every time it came on...so I woke up cold the next morning. Huddling under the blankets to attempt the last couple hours of precious rest, I was disturbed by the sounds of maids using the laundry next to my room, and the distinct sounds of another guest in an adjoining room, stirring something in a cup and speaking. I was amazed that the walls were so thin! Getting up with sore hips from the hard mattress, I searched the room in vain for a coffee maker...another amenity I guess I've been taking for granted. I guess in short, even if my destination has some charm and the draw of natural features, if I can't get a good night's rest, I won't be inclined to return. Hope this review helps someone's decision-making.",

My sister had broken her leg a couple of weeks earlier and the weekend proved to be a bit much for her. The Roman Spa provided a wheel chair, not only for getting around the resort, but for getting to dinner and around town as well. I've even taken my young niece and nephew, who are preteens, to the Roman Spa for an unforgettable weekend. They loved the warm pools. Great restaurants and shopping are all close by.

The beds aren't as bad as some people have stated but are by no means great. The main problem with this hotel is that the trains constantly run and it's LOUD. I was awoken repeatedly - it sounds and feels like an earthquake. I am normally not someone who gets up at every little sound. I'm guess I would stay here again for one night if I was on a budget, but if you are trying to have a relaxing time, consider whether you can afford a few extra bucks to stay somewhere without the train commotion.",

After our four days stay, we have decided this is going to be \"our Istanbul hotel\" that we will be coming back to whenever there. Location is perfect, just off the main street which makes it less noisy and enables you to sleep, yet just few steps away from the main happening. Breakfast is nice, buffet type and you can additionally order anything you want. The option of pick up at the airport if you are staying more than 3 nights is very nice and it was comforting to see the sign with your name at a busy airport in Istanbul. Hotel is very near Taksim square (5min walk) where you can get the metro, bus, taxi to go to other parts of the city. Really enjoyed this stay and will hopefully be going there soon again.",

Our room (two doubles) was just great - very comfy beds (lots of pillows), clean attractive rooms and spacious enough for two. The fitness area has very up-to-date equipment and is suitable for all your basic needs. Pool is spacious, clean and great for both kids (somewhat shallow) or adults who want to swim laps. Our package included breakfast which was wonderful. A buffet variety hat would more than meet anyone's appetite needs. Close walking distance to many attractions: Theatres, Various Restaurants, Chinatown, Faneuil Hall, Quincy Market, Aquarium or to the Boylston T stop Green Line. We took a tour of Fenway Stadium - loved it. We would definately return again to this Hyatt!",

We got a room on the 20th floor with beautiful views of the city and the water (maybe because we were their Gold member). The bed was so soft and huge for two people. The location is convenient within walking distance to everything: Chinatown (2 blocks), subway (red line is right around the corner), movie theaters (couple of blocks), opera house (just across the street), Boston Common, Fenuil Hall, Quincy market, shopping centers, North Street to the Old North Church and little Italy. By the way, if you like Italian food, try Antico Forno (93 Salem St, North End). The food was absolutely delicious, and the price was very reasonable. The only thing we didn't like about Boston is that the parking fee was outrageous ($26/night for self parking underneath the hotel). Use this one. Don't use the one across the street. It is not cheaper ($25/night). Be aware of the parking attentant at this parking lot. We used them the first night. The guy said that it would be $22/night for overnight parking. But when we went the next morning to get our car, the attendant demanded $25. We disagreed and paid $22. He didn't like it, but let us go. They changed their price on the board the next day. We parked our car in the garage underneath the hotel for the rest of our stay. No trouble after that. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel to everybody.",

Luckily we only had to spend a night there after a mix up with booking our original hotel (The Modern Sultan, much, much better) The room is a joke, measures about 2 meters by 3 metres, with dilapidated furniture and a general grubby appearance. And the bathroom? It was so small I could sit on the toilet, brush my teeth in the sink and have a shower ALL AT THE SAME TIME!! It was very noisy, with a main street right outside the building, so plenty of traffic. We could clearly hear people stomping around the hotel until the early ours of the morning. And the lift? Enough room for one person, and no door to the cubicle, so you're seeing bare stone pass 2 inches from your nose. On the plus side, the terrace was nice.",

The room was small as was the bathroom with it's Turkish shower (no shower surround), however these were minor inconveniences weighed against the perfect location & fabulous staff. The day starts with a Turkish buffet breakfast on the top floor with a view of the Bosphorus. The area is also open during the day & evening to any guest wanting to enjoy some quiet time and the view. Watch out for the endless cups of Turkish tea you will be offered if you want to sleep at night! All major attractions are within a 5 minute walk, as is the metro and the ferry. Surrounded by restaurants of all price ranges and rug & china stores where charming proprietors try to entice you to view their wares. A great day is to buy a 1 way ticket on the 10:30 Bosphorus tour ferry at Eminonu (be there at 10:00). Get off at Saiyer and walk back thru town picking up some snacks on the way. Walk back along the river about 15 mins to Buyukdere for the Sadberk Hanim Museum (allow 2 hrs Thur - Tue). Then turn right & walk to the bus stop, catch 25E to Bebek and visit the Rumelihisari fortress (9:00 - 4:30 except Wed). Then catch the 25E again to Ortakoy. Get your stuffed potato and waffle and wander the streets. Continue on the 25E to Kabatas and then change to the metro to get back.",

First of all this Hotel is right across the street from the pier that Carnival sails from. The morning of the cruise you grab your bags walk across the street and you are on the ship. Also, it's location in Old San Juan is perfect to sight see in this beautiful city. We opted to upgrade to a suite for $25.00 additional and WOW, we ended up getting the Governor's Suite. Dining room for 8, beautiful living room with big screen TV, seperate King bedroom, 3 balconies and a great view of one of the forts. What a way to start a trip. The people at the hotel were very helpful with sight seeing tips,and restaurant suggestions. All in all I give this hotel a big thumbs up. Hotel outside could use some new paint.",

A post office, CVS and a few restaurants were right around the corner and it was a short walk to the forts, additional restaurants and shopping. We received vouchers for breakfast at the hotel, which was another highlight. Made to order omelets, a selection of fruits and breads, hot items like sausage and potatoes, along with pastries and oatmeal rounded out a filling and healthy breakfast. We also visited the rooftop pool and saw fireworks one evening. The gym is open 24/7 and included TVs, water machine and the essentials. During the week, the hotel was quiet and the smokefree casino was not a problem, people there weren't rowdy or loud. We did have loud neighbors one evening, but they turned off the music at midnight, so no problems sleeping. Otherwise, the hotel was about 45-60 minutes from the El Yunque and about 1.5 hours from snorkeling in Farajardo.",

Ignore any negatives and enjoy this place. Room 633 had a \"juliet balcony\" with view of the cruise ship docks.Again just great and I can heartly reccommend it. I am a senior and the peace and quiet, consideration and helpful suggestions from the front desk and T. Schmidtz were much appreciated.. Go and have a good time..",

We took a few bags with us that we did not want to leave with bellman (laptop and purse/cameras) and found a place for lunch that was so-so after walking up and down some streets when a local resident recommended a place to us. The map the hotel clerk had given us and mentioned place for lunch adjacent was closed. We went back to the hotel after lunch, and were told by another desk clerk we had to wait and that many others ahead of us, but then fortunately the woman desk clerk (she had talked to us initially to check in earlier) said okay to let us have our room. We had booked one overlooking the bay. Once we had our room we immediately crashed to sleep for hours. Later we went out for dinner and walked along Paseo de la Princessa which was a delightful introduction to San Jose in the evening with beautiful fountains, music, and vendors - totally enjoyable. Back to the hotel for a good night's rest before taking a taxi to go to the Celebrity cruise ship at another pier the next day. The room had a safe so we could lock up valuables and hotel was in a good location. We ate breakfast at the hotel in the morning which was decent (but expensive) and wait staff was not attentive to refill coffee or water or take order. In summary, good hotel in nice location but don't expect great service. I had to use my data card as I could not get Internet to work.",

I booked the G-suite after I figured out it would accommodate our group of 3 adults and 2 kids and be cheaper than 2 rooms. The suite was very large including a king sized bedroom and a massive entry/dining/living room area with great views of the city and port. We had a roll-away bed brought up and between that, the king bed, and the sofa pullout had room for all. The location was great for our needs. We were able to hike around OSJ and then when it was time to get on the boat we literally walked across the street. I have 2 issues with the place. First is that standards of cleanliness are not on par with other Sheraton's. Not flithy, but just not completely clean. Second, is that the decor and furnishings were in my opinion not up to \"Governor\" standards. The furniture was a bit worn and some of it really did not match with the decor, minor point no doubt. If you are booking the suite for the lap of luxury look elsewhere, if you want a big place to spread out this is it.",

Hotel is located right at the port for Carnival Cruise Line which was great as I stayed 2 nights prior to sailing. You can actually walk to the pier if you do not have much luggage and can walk a distance. However I took a taxi. $10.00. Service is great especially the doormen. There is a trolly stop 1 1/2 blks from hotel which is free. There are 2-trolley routes (2-buses), 1 trolley is enclosed which will take you to all the shopping in Old San Juan. You can hop off/on throughout the route. The bus run frequently!! The other trolley route, an open air trolley will take you to all the historical sites, i.e. the fort, museums, etc. Both of the trolley begin and end at the same location wihich is 1 1/2 blks in either direction of the Sheraton. There is a great restaurant behind the hotel called Latin Roots with great food. You must try the Roasted Pork which you will see a whole pig roasting in the window. You can get a combo which is 1/2 lb. pork and 2-sides for $12.00, or 1/2 lb meat only for $8.00. Inside the hotel is Chicago Beef Co. with good burgers if you must eat at hotel. The swimming pool at the hotel is on the roof with and excellant view of the Bay and the ships. Its great for enjoying the sun and relaxing and a nice pool and whirllpool. Very nice and quaint. Finally, the room was nice size and the beds at the Sheraton are really comfy. There is a casino at the hotel also if you are a gambler and they serve free drinks while gambling. I would highly recommend staying here if you want to be in Old San Juan. Great location, and great accommodations!!",

One of the two treadmills was broken and when we reported it to the front desk, they shrugged. One morning we were awoken by the maid service before 8 a.m.; the next day they never came. We had to call the front desk three times that evening before someone came to drop off clean sheets and towels (though they did not offer to make up the beds or clean up). Other anomalies about this hotel include barking dogs in the hallways in the early morning(?); lots of small unsupervised children screaming in the gym and the pool. Because I have the Starwoods Credit Card, I typically stay at Starwoods properties (LeMeridien, Sheraton, W, etc.) This one felt more akin to a motel than a multi-star hotel.",

The staff at the hotel were outstanding in every way. They consistently excelled in their service and their attention to any needs we may have had. The complimentary car is a fabulous amenity and was greatly utilized and appreciated during our stay. We stayed in one of the suites and found the room to be perfect for our needs as we had 3 adults and a toddler. Our suite had 2 queen beds and a living room area with a pull out couch and a second standard couch. The living room had a large flat screen tv and the bedroom area had a smaller flat screen tv. The hotel is very nice in and of itself but the staff is really what makes this place shine. I cant recommend it enough and would definitely stay there again.",

The feeling and energy, amazing. Somehow despite having all the modcons you could want to keep you happy, the hotel has retained its original look and feel inside (think early 1900's glamour), and maintained it from the rooms to the public areas.... and the resulting energy is excellent and a far cry from modern, cookie cutter hotels. My only hesitation and the reason why I did not give this a 5 is because they need another elevator when things get busy. (I wanted to give a 4.5 but didn't have that option). Highly recommended for business or pleasure, I will be back.",

My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel last spring for our anniversary and wanted to be sure to tell you what an amazing time we had. My husband planned the entire thing without my knowledge so thank you the staff for helping him make it perfect for both of us! The hotel property itself is stunning and welcomes you immediately. We booked the \"shaken and stirred\" package which included a full breakfast in the Hunt Club restaurant (on-site) and in-room martinis. We highly recommend this package if it's still available. All I can say is WOW! Everything about our stay went perfectly from the valet greeting us all the way through our check-out and even included a call to our room a few minutes after arrival to ensure everything was perfect. They clearly understand what customer service means and they made us feel like nothing would be a problem if we asked. MARTINIS: We didn't know what to expect in the way of martini fixings in the room but we were pleasantly surprised. They supplied everything you need to make the martinis: martini glasses, lemon, zester, olives, toothpicks, shaker, ice and a nice bottle of SKY Vodka (enough for 2 drinks each). They also included a nice note to wish us a happy anniversary (nice touch). ROOM SVC: We really enjoyed our in room dining. The food was amazing and arrived sooner than expected since the hotel/restaurant were extremely busy that night. THE ROOM: The bed and linens were luxurious! You won't be ready to leave them in the morning...I promise :)! The bathroom was a little small - wished they would have had a soaking tub at least. We were in a standard room so they might have them in the suites...maybe next time :). We did not ask for an upgrade but somehow I think they would have done it if they had the availability at the time. BREAKFAST: The food in the Hunt Club was delicious and plentiful. My husband had the french toast (which could feed 3 people) and I had the quiche which also could feed 2-3 people. Our waitress was very helpful and very attentive (although not overly so). We have no hesitation about recommending this place for anyone who needs a little time away at an affordable price. You'll feel like you must have spent a fortune here when you leave because of the beauty of the property and the atmosphere you're in. However, you'll feel anything but poor when you leave this luxury hotel...truly refreshing! The service at this hotel once again gave me reason to believe that there are a few great hotels still out there that believe that \"hospitality\" really does mean being hospitable and accommodating to your guests. We never felt like an inconvenience to anyone and our money wasn't your first concern. Well done! It's been a difficult year for us (and lots of other folks) financially but if we can afford it we'll be back to celebrate again in February (maybe a suite this time). Thanks again for an amazing experience!",

Loved the older type hotel, had a charming ambiance, nice break from big chain hotels. Location is good, short walk to waterfront, plenty of cafes nearby to get espresso, speaking of coffe they had french press in room to make coffee which was a very nice touch. We valeted our car at the hotel, it is more than the public parking garages but not by much and when you consider you have access to your car 24/7 worth the extra money, valets were qucik and very nice. We did not dine at the hotel, but I did use the gym which was good for a hotel. Part of my visit I choose to just stay in the room rather than walk around city because I found it so comfortable and appealling. Usuually do not do reviews, but thought this hotel deserved it. Both my husband and I would look forward to staying there again.",

Thanks to the complimentary car service, we left our car in the garage and played tourist in our hometown. The car service dropped us off downtown so we could shop, eat and sightsee, then we rang him when we were ready to return. He was there within minutes to wisk us back to the hotel where we had a drink in the fireside room and listened to live jazz. The whole experience was top-notch! I highly recommend the Sorrento Hotel for visitors to my amazing hometown.",

The Public Market was about 5 blocks and all the quaint little places to eat and drink coffee were walking distance. Close to the museum and great part of town. Would definately stay again. The room was a bit small but that comes with older hotels. They had a restaurant that we did not eat at, but seemed nice and a separate bar that of course with hotels, you will pay a much higher price for. The staff was wonderful and provided great service along with providing needed directions.",

                  "content": "I didn't choose the Sorrento Hotel; it was chosen for me. And thank goodness! In a world of mediocrity and warmed-over â€œclock-watchingâ€� hospitality, the Sorrento Hotel proved to this weary business traveler that there are owners and staff members who still focus on the customer experience. Like everything else in life, it's the little things that make the difference. Thanks to a delayed flight, I was denied the opportunity to enjoy an evening meal during my travels, and arrived at the hotel at 11:00 PM (exactly when the kitchen closes). I asked the server if there were any cold items that might tide me over until morning. He did one better: he convinced the kitchen to conjure up one more Huntsburger with smoked bacon, Huntsman cheese, and crispy fries (every bit as good as it sounds). Upon entering the room, I was astounded to find that my king-bedded room had a walk-in closet. My first car wasn't as big as this closet. In the bathroom - with Italian marble - there was a place for everything: shaver, lotion, toothbrush, shampoo, etc. How many times have you ever-so-carefully balanced all of your toiletries on the side of the deco sink, only to find them in the sink drain or on the floor moments later? This detail is too often overlooked in hotel renovations (tsk, tsk); which brings us to the study desk in the room. I like WiFi as much as the next business traveler - where would we be without it? But for those of us with a VOIP phone and/or a webcam, wired Internet access is the only way to go. You can imagine my shock and awe when I plugged my ethernet cable into the desktop port and witnessed the warm glow of link lights. I was almost as happy as my two-year-old daughter was to see \"daddy on the computer\". Every hotel on the planet brags about their bedding and linens. Sorrento is the first in my road-warrior career to back it up. Enough said. Heading down for breakfast my first morning, I noticed the word \"Monday\" monogrammed in the carpet in the elevator, and couldn't figure out what it meant. It wasn't until Tuesday morning that I figured it out after seeing that \"Monday\" had been replaced by \"Tuesday\". Wow!! In my defense, I had not had any coffee at that time. : - ) Breakfast - served by a professionally cheerful server by the name of Tim - was Salmon Eggs Benedict. Yes indeed. My meeting was held in the hotel - the Ravello Room (I think) - and was adequate in every way. Now if we can only do something about the car horns in Seattle... You would have thought we were closer to New York City. I just don't think I'll ever get used to that. After the meeting, Kody at the concierge desk recommended that we take a walk to the Pike Place Market. It seemed a far walk; but when broken up by a quick bite to eat, truly is an enjoyable walk (not to mention that the walk from the Sorrento to Pike Place Market is ALL DOWNHILL). The walk back to the hotel was not as friendly, but we resolved to walk the whole way, unless one of us collapsed from exhaustion. We didn't, and we have a new found respect for Seattle pedestrians, bicyclists, and parking brakes. After two days of meetings, it was time to return home. As my flight was at 6:00 AM, the front desk agent offered to brew some fresh coffee for her first check-out at 4:00 AM. Her offer was angelic and quickly accepted by yours truly. As I was driven to the airport in the rain, I told myself that I would post an online review of my experience. There is a saying that if a guest has a good experience at your hotel, he will tell three people. If a guest has a bad experience, he will tell ten people. I want to do my part to reverse this trend, because the Sorrento Hotel truly deserves the word of mouth. Heck, I may even tell more than ten people. But Iâ€™m still not going to use my car horn. : - )",
